## Installation

To install the game, download the latest artifact from the main branch GitHub action.

Supported platforms: _Windows_, _MacOS_, _Linux_.

## Build from Source

Prerequisite:
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [.NET Core 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch all dependencies.
2. Run `./build.ps1` on Windows and `./build/sh` on other systems to produce binary files under `out` folder.
3. Run `dotnet build` for C# only changes.

> The only way to rebuild  shaders (`*.fx` files) today is using Visual Studio on Windows due to dependency on `Microsoft.HLSL.CSharpVB`.
